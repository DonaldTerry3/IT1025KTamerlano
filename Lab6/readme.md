## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network.

The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. The IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. IPv6 provides a large address space, and it contains a simple header as compared to IPv4.

#### IP Address:example address might be 192.158. 1.38
#### ICANN:For example, the domain name "whois.icann.org" has three levels of hierarchy: "org" is the top-level, "icann" is the second-level, and "whois" is the third-level
Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN is responsible for coordinating the management of the technical elements of the DNS to ensure universal resolvability so that all users of the Internet can find all valid addresses.

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by using what's known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure.
