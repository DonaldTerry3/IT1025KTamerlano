## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:Unit of data 
#### Packet-Switching:Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
#### IP Address:Unique identifying number 

#### DNS:Directory of IP address common names.

#### Protocol:Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
Switches are considered as intelligent devices. Switches sends packets to only that port which has the requirement for same. Switches identifies the device using their MAC address. Whereas hub sends packets to every ports, hence increasing unnecessary traffic. Switches maintain security whereas hubs lacks in maintaining the same.
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
Hubs and switches allow the connection of multiple components to form a local area network while routers are needed for bridging computers and peripherals on a local network to another network or the Internet.
### Network Topologies
Single point of failure is where an array of servers is networked through a single network switch. If the switch failed or simply became disconnected from its power source, all of the servers connected to that switch would become inaccessible from the rest of the network. Topology defines the structure of the network of how all the components are interconnected to each other. There are two types of topology: physical and logical topology. Physical topology is the geometric representation of all the nodes in a network. A wireless mesh network is created through the connection of wireless access point (WAP) nodes installed at each network user's locale. An infrastructure topology is used to extend a wired LAN to include wireless devices. Wireless mesh is better because it manages high amounts of traffic, because multiple devices can transmit data simultaneously.

### Network Design
This diagram of infrastructure topology shows the devices communicating with the wired LAN via base stations called an AP, which acts as a bridge between wired and wireless LANs.
### NSA/CSS

###Protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

## Cybersecurity and Encryption
