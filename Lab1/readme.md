## Information System Components
Information systems collect, store, organize, and distribute data throughout the organization. You may have even realized that one of the roles of information systems is to take data and turn it into information, and then transform that information into organizational knowledge. As technology has developed, this role has evolved into the backbone of the organization, making information systems integral to virtually every business. When thinking about information systems, it is easy to focus on the technology components and forget to look beyond these tools to fully understand their integration into an organization. A focus on the people involved in information systems is the next step. From the front-line user support staff, to systems analysts, to developers, all the way up to the chief information officer, the people involved with information systems are an essential element. Amazon has developed different software and hardware such as Fire TV and its software Fire OS, that is used on all devices. Data is gathered from the platfors to achieve the ultimate goal to improve processes both internally and externally, enhancing interfaces with suppliers and customers.
