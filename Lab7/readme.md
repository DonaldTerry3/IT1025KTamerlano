## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
File compression is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or the Internet. It enables the creation of a version of one or more files with the same data at a size substantially smaller than the original file.
### Compression and File Size
After the photo was compressed the size of the photo became smaller. If a JPEG file is compressed the size of the file is reduced so that the file size can fit disk or memory space.
