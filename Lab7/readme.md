## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
File compression is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or the Internet. It enables the creation of a version of one or more files with the same data at a size substantially smaller than the original file.
### Compression and File Size
After the photo was compressed the size of the photo became smaller. If a JPEG file is compressed the size of the file is reduced so that the file size can fit disk or memory space.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
### Methods:
### Constructor:
### Class vs. Object

## Object Oriented Concepts
I.. What is/are the attribute(s) of the shark class? Remember attributes (which may also be refered to as properties or data) are characteristics of an object.
Object oriented programming which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions. When working on complex programs in particular, object-oriented programming lets you reuse code and write code that is more readable, which in turn makes it more maintainable.

II.. What are the methods of the shark class? Remember methods are things that an object can do.  If it were a car object, it could stop, go and accelerate.
1)Swim 
2)Be_awesome 
III.. What is the purpose of a constructor?  
The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
IV.. What is a class vs. an object and what does it mean to "instantiate an object from a class?" 
Class — A blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class.
Object — An instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program.
### Instantiated Objects
What command did you use to instantiate an object and what are the instantiated objects of the shark class? 
 The command used to initiate an object was sammy = Shark() __init__. Instantiated objects is an instance of an object can be declared by giving it a unique name that can be used in a program.
What is inheritance in OOP? Provide an example related to the shark class. 
 
### Inheritance
Inheritance is a class derives from another class.
example:   class Shark:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
