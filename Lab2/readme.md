## Executive Summary 
COLLAPSE
I have experience with the software development life cycle on many different platforms in which I needed some sort of support. I am an iPhone user and there are always new updates and bug fixes within the device or to upgrade the security of the device. Sometimes apps crash and I need to check for updates, close and reopen apps, force close app, restart the device, or delete the app completely. Another experience with SDLC is with video games. When games first launch, it is common for there to be many bugs to be fixed. I think that this happens more now that games are digital and I do not believe that there are beta testers anymore.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU sends the output to the register which acts like ram and is processed in CPU. The enable wire is turned on by control unit and outputs and number stored. The CPU is the brain of the computer. 
### CPU, Input & Output
Input Converts physical input to binary information such as a keybord. Memory stores the input information and CPU calculates the information. The CPU can run information such as how to draw the letter B and run it in pixles. Output converts information to physical output such as a computer screen. 
### Logic Gates
Truth table summarizes inputs and outputs. It shows the output you get (ones or zeros) for every possible imput (each separate row of the table describes one of the possible sets of imputs and outputs). An AND logic gate works the same way with two electrical inputs. If both inputs are switched on (that is, carry a number 1), the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise the output will be 0. An OR logic gate works this way with two electrical inputs. If either input is switched on (that is, carries a number 1), the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise the output will be 0.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The IEEE TechEthics program focuses on the third bullet, seeking to ensure that ethical and societal implications of technology become an integral part of the development process by driving conversation and debate on these issues.
## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
### Hexadecimal Color Representation

## Conclusion
One system development methodology I researched is Agile. Agile was developed as a response to growing frustrations with Waterfall and other highly structured, stubborn methodologies. This method is used to accommodate change and the need to produce software faster. Agile features customer collaboration and response to change instead of a set-in-stone plan that focuses on presenting working software. Using the Agile approach teams develop in short iterations that work towards the goal of making working software. Agile focuses on team strengths and efficiency along with feedback from departments and clients.
