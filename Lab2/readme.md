## Executive Summary 
COLLAPSE
I have experience with the software development life cycle on many different platforms in which I needed some sort of support. I am an iPhone user and there are always new updates and bug fixes within the device or to upgrade the security of the device. Sometimes apps crash and I need to check for updates, close and reopen apps, force close app, restart the device, or delete the app completely. Another experience with SDLC is with video games. When games first launch, it is common for there to be many bugs to be fixed. I think that this happens more now that games are digital and I do not believe that there are beta testers anymore.

## Conclusion
One system development methodology I researched is Agile. Agile was developed as a response to growing frustrations with Waterfall and other highly structured, stubborn methodologies. This method is used to accommodate change and the need to produce software faster. Agile features customer collaboration and response to change instead of a set-in-stone plan that focuses on presenting working software. Using the Agile approach teams develop in short iterations that work towards the goal of making working software. Agile focuses on team strengths and efficiency along with feedback from departments and clients.
