Application is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application. Example 
microsoft office.

In computers, a utility is a small program that provides an addition to the capabilities provided by the operating system.An example would be antivirus.

An operating system is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other
application programs in a computer. An example is linux.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) refers to a type of software that organizations use to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement,
project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations.

Visualization:Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to
use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.Software called hypervisors separate the physical 
resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system or be
installed directly onto hardware, which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up
so that virtual environments can use them.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented
programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
development in many areas on most platforms.

In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target
machine. Instead, a different program, or the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
