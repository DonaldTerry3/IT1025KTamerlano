## Data, Information and Knowledge

Data representation:
Hexidecimal is different from binary and decimal. It uses base sixteen, meaning there are sixteen different digits that can appear in a single place. 
Binary numbers are composed of 0 or 1 and decimals are composed of 0 to 9. 
To convert to decimal to binary using base 2 to the power from 1 to 7. If number cannot fit add 0 if can fit add 1 and subtract number. to convert binary 
to decimal add all numbers unfer one in sequence and the sum is answer. 
In a RGB color space, hex #ab0fff is composed of 67.1% red, 5.9% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 94.1% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 279 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 52.9%. #ab0fff color hex could be obtained by blending #ff1eff with #5700ff. Closest websafe color is: #9900ff. The color violet may be problematic becasue it is close to red. The hardest colors to see are Red and Green. 

### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:Primary and foreign keys help create structure in relational databases. A primary key ensures unique row identification. This results in faster sorting, searching, and querying operations.
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
#### Foreign key of orders table:A foreign key creates a link between two tables.
### Field Data Types

### Big Data

Data and Buisness Decisions
Three business decisions that could be answered with a well-designed database.

1.)Businesses can utilize outside intelligence while taking decisions.
Access to social data from search engines and sites like Facebook and Twitter is enabling organizations to fine-tune their business strategies.

2.)Improved customer service
Traditional customer feedback systems are getting replaced by new systems designed with Big Data technologies. In these new systems, Big Data and natural language processing technologies are being used to read and evaluate consumer responses. 

3.)Early identification of risk to the product/services, if any, and better operational efficiency.
Big Data technologies can be used for creating a staging area or landing zone for new data before identifying what data should be moved to the data warehouse. In addition, such integration of Big Data technologies and data warehouses helps an organization to offload infrequently accessed data.


#### Four "V"s of Big Data
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Social media and jet engines have demand for big data. 
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
The primary way to work with a relational database is to use Structured Query Language, SQL. Almost all applications that work with databases make use of SQL as a way to analyze and manipulate relational data. As its name implies, SQL is a language that can be used to work with a relational database. From a simple request for data to a complex update operation, SQL is a mainstay of programmers and database administrators.
A NoSQL database can work with data in a looser way, allowing for a more unstructured environment, communicating changes to the data over time to all the servers that are part of the database.
### RDBMS and SQL
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys
Primary and foreign keys help create structure in relational databases. A primary key ensures unique row identification. This results in faster sorting, searching, and querying operations. A foreign key creates a link between two tables.
## SQL Injections
SQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server. The only sure way to prevent SQL Injection attacks is input validation and parametrized queries including prepared statements. 
## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
One method for navigating new ethical waters is a code of ethics. A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group. The document details different actions that are considered appropriate and inappropriate. The ACM created Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur.


### Intellectual Property
A trademark most often protects IP associated with companies, such as a word, phrase, symbol or design used to identify and promote products or services. Companies may also use a service mark, which protects their services in the same way trademarks protect their goods. It is impotant to copyright the svg image because the owner can then invoice or even sue you for damages. Copyright is the protection given to songs, computer programs, books, and other creative works; any work that has an “author” can be copyrighted.

To comply with COPPA, organizations must make a good-faith effort to determine the age of those accessing their websites and, if users are under thirteen years old, must obtain parental consent before collecting any information.

FERPA is a US law that protects the privacy of student education records.In brief, this law specifies that parents have a right to their child’s educational information until the child reaches either the age of eighteen or begins attending school beyond the high school level. At that point, control of the information is given to the child. 

HIPAA is the law the specifically singles out records related to health care as a special class of personally identifiable information. This law gives patients specific rights to control their medical records, requires health care providers and others who maintain this information to get specific permission in order to share it, and imposes penalties on the institutions that breach this trust.
